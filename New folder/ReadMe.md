-# 📢 Tip Calculator

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **Tip Calculator** web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to quickly and easily calculate the tip amount and total amount per person when splitting a bill.

The interface is clean and responsive, providing instant feedback and results as the user interacts with the calculator. It visually alerts users when required fields are missing or invalid and enables the reset button once valid inputs are provided.

This project focuses on mastering **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **form validation** using vanilla JavaScript, along with clean UI design via CSS Flexbox and Grid.
